# Embedded-Systems-Final
Our final project 

Trevor Kaufman
&
Kathleen Scafidi

Trevor and Kathleen met up to work on the project multiple times. The circuit construction was both team members, but Trevor was in charge of actually building the circuit while Kathleen gave informatoin about pins. Similarly, Kathleen was the driver of the code while Trevor helped make any adjustments needed. These tasks were done together during meetng times in the library.
